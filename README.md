# 42_ft_printf
> This project you will try to recode the standard function printf.
# About the project
> This project is perfect you will recode the standard function printf. and thing how mainly learn to use variadic arguments.
> Printf allows you to explore parsing and learn deeply about variadic functions in C.
# in mandatory part you will handle this format below
 - %c Prints a single character.  
 - %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
 - %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
 - %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
 - %i Prints an integer in base 10. 
 - %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number. 
 - %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
 - %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format. 
 - %% Prints a percent sign.
 # and bonus 
 - your function will handling this (#, +, space) flags
 ## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
 
**1. Compiling the library **

To compile without flags, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```
To compile with flags, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make bonus
```
**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "./includes/ft_printf.h"
```
